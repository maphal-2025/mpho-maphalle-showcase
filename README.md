# Subject: Career Roadmap in Software Testing – Your Insight Would Mean a Lot!
Hi Zeblon Oigo,
I hope you're well! I've been reflecting on my journey in software testing and put together a roadmap outlining my short-term and long-term career goals. It includes the roles I aim for, the skills and certifications I plan to pursue, and areas I’d love to grow in—especially around defect management, test automation, and ethical QA practices.
I’d be incredibly grateful for your feedback. Do the steps I’ve mapped out make sense given industry trends? Are there skill gaps or technologies you think I should explore further?
Your guidance would really help me refine the plan and take meaningful steps toward becoming a thoughtful and impactful QA professional. I’ve attached a one-pager for a quick overview, and I’m happy to walk through it if you'd prefer.
Thanks so much in advance for your time and support!
Warm regards, Mpho
